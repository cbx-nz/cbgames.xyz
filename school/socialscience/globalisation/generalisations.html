      <li>Patterns of the Global Distribution of Wealth<p>
        The global distribution of wealth shows that there are some patterns that <br> generalisations can be made from,
        looking at the map that has been <br> created based off the global distribution of wealth. The different  
        patterns show <br> how and where the countries have different income around the world. Based <br> on the countries  
        in the northern hemisphere, most very high-income countries <br> are in the northern hemisphere. There is more
        than half of the <br> low-income countries near each other in Africa, those countries are quite close<br> 
        together so it would make sense that all those three are low-income.<br> 2nd lowest (medium) income
        countries are either in Africa or Asia. Based <br>on the evidence, global wealth is unevenly distributed. The map highlights
      that<br>most very high-income countries are concentrated in the northern hemisphere, including<br>regions such as north america,
    western europe, and parts of east asia.<br>The majority of low-income countries are clustered close together in Sub-Saharan<br>
  Africa, where more of the half of the world's poorest nations are located.<br>These countries are geographically close, which makes sense
why they contribute to shared<br>economic challenges such as limited access to education, healthcare, and infrastructure. Many<br>
medium-income countries are found in parts of Asia and Africa,<br>reflecting economies that are transitioning but still facing barriers to
wealth growth.<br><b>This pattern creates a geographical link to economic statuses, where location and regional<br>factors influence
a country's income level and opportunities to development.</b></p>
