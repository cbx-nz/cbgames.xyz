<h2>What do these words mean?</h2>
<hr>
<p><strong>Docking</strong>: the practice of shortening a sheep's tail, often to reduce the risk of flystrike and improve hygiene</p>
<p>- <strong>Why is this done?</strong> to prevent fly strike and improve cleanliness</p>
<p><strong>Flushing</strong>: a practice of increasing the nutritional intake of ewes (female sheep) prior to mating</p>
<p><strong>Tupping</strong>: refers to the mating season, also known as the "breeding season" or "ramming season"</p>
<p><strong>Vaccination</strong>: It involves administering vaccines, which help the animal's immune system develop antibodies against specific diseases, making them less susceptible to future infections.  </p>
<p><strong>Drenching</strong>: the administration of liquid medications, typically through a drench gun, to animals to control parasites, such as worms, or to provide essential nutrients or minerals</p>
<p><strong>Tagging</strong>: a crucial practice for animal identification, tracing, and disease management</p>
<p><strong>Castration</strong>: the disruption of testicular function, usually by removal of the testes of male animals</p>
<p><strong>Weaning</strong>: physically separating calves (or lambs, kids, etc.) from their mothers, typically at around 5-7 months of age, to transition them to a diet of solid feeds</p>
