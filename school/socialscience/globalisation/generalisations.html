<h1>Generalisations & Patterns of the Global Distribution of Wealth Map </h1>
</div>

<h3> Generalisations: </h3>

<ol type="I">
  <li> Most very high-income countries are in the northern hemisphere.</li> 
  <li> 3 of the 5 low-income countries are near each other in Africa. </li>
  <li> All medium income countries are either in Asia or Africa.</li>
</ol>
    <h3>Full Peel Paragraph: </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Patterns of the Global Distribution of Wealth<p>The global distribution of wealth shows that there are some patterns that generalisations can be made from, <br>looking at the map that has been created based off the global distribution of wealth. The different <br> patterns show how and where the countries have different income around the world. Based on the countries <br> in the northern hemisphere, most very high-income countries are in the northern hemisphere. There is more<br> than half of the low-income countries near each other in Africa, those countries are quite close<br> together so it would make sense that all those three are low income. 2nd lowest (medium) income<br> countries are either in Africa or Asia.</p></li>
